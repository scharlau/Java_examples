'Tis the answer to What? and How? and Why?  And Whence? and Whither? -- a word whereby      The Truth (with the comfort it brings)  Is open to all who grope in night,  Crying for Wisdom's holy light.  Whether the word is a verb or a noun      Is knowledge beyond my reach.  I only know that 'tis handed down.          From sage to sage,          From age to age --      An immortal part of speech!  Of an ancient man the tale is told  That he lived to be ten centuries old,      In a cave on a mountain side.      (True, he finally died.)  The fame of his wisdom filled the land,  For his head was bald, and you'll understand      His beard was long and white      And his eyes uncommonly bright.  Philosophers gathered from far and near  To sit at his feet and hear and hear,          Though he never was heard          To utter a word      But "_Abracadabra, abracadab_,          _Abracada, abracad_,      _Abraca, abrac, abra, ab!_"          'Twas all he had,  'Twas all they wanted to hear, and each  Made copious notes of the mystical speech,          Which they published next --          A trickle of text  In the meadow of commentary.      Mighty big books were these,      In a number, as leaves of trees;  In learning, remarkably -- very!          He's dead,          As I said,  And the books of the sages have perished,  But his wisdom is sacredly cherished.  In _Abracadabra_ it solemnly rings,  Like an ancient bell that forever swings.          O, I love to hear          That word make clear  Humanity's General Sense of Things.Jamrach HolobomABRIDGE, v.t.  To shorten.
